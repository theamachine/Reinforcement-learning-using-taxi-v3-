In this project, Reinforcement Learning algorithm was built to train an agent that can interact with simple environments such as:

* Taxi-v3
* FrozenLake-v0
* CliffWalking-v0

The given case file has been changed into a set of general functions to be used with any environment. Also, Q-tables were listed for each training environment. Then, hyperparameter tunining was done. Finally, A grid search was initiated and chose "alpha" at 0.2, "epsilon" at 0.3 and "gamma" at 0.1.
